Monitors MAC addresses on your router's DD-WRT, signals servo appropriately (lock/unlock)

Rather than trying to use the (unsupported) makefiles, it is best to compile with the arduino IDE and copy the hex file that is written to /tmp

The included hex files are for a continuous servo, which will rotate 160 degrees. Adjust yours as you see fit.
